				<h2>2018 (December) - 2019 (February)</h2>
				<p>Worked at NSK Trade City Pandan, JB, as a cashier for 3 months until I had to continue my studies on May. It was my first job ever and I've gained so much experience in the world of working.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>2019 (December) - 2020 (January)</h2>
				<p>I went back to NSK Trade City Pandan as a cashier again, except it was only for a month since I was having my first semester break.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>2021 (September) - 2021 (October)</h2>
				<p>After finished my STPM, I worked at AEON Mall Tebrau City, JB, as sales assistant in Sushi department line. It was quite challenging since personally I dont like working at F&amp;B departments, hence that's why I only worked for over a month there.</p>

				<h2>2021 (December) - 2021 (February)</h2>
				<p>After leaving Aeon, I worked at Mr.DIY, as a cashier since I had some experience in that department. Until I got a call for my degree.</p>
